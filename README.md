# Project Description

A lightweight Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework.

Describe behaviour in plain text using the Gherkin business language, i.e. Given, When, Then.

Easily execute the behaviour against matching F# tick methods, attributed C# or F# methods.

    let ``tick method`` () = true

# Installation

Simply reference TickSpec via [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TickSpec/), download the assembly or build the project from source.
TickSpec works in Visual Studio 2015 & 2017.
To run NUnit based examples, please ensure that toy have installed the `NUnit 2 Test Adapter` tool via **Tools|Extensions And Updates**.
Historically, Silverlight was supported; this support and the related examples were removed in 2017 (but remain in the commit history for the archeologically inclined)

# Feature specification (Plain text)

```
Feature: Refunded or replaced items should be returned to stock

Scenario 1: Refunded items should be returned to stock
    Given a customer buys a black jumper
    And I have 3 black jumpers left in stock
    When he returns the jumper for a refund
    Then I should have 4 black jumpers in stock
```

# Step definitions (F#)

```
type StockItem = { Count : int }

let mutable stockItem = { Count = 0 }

let [<Given>] ``a customer buys a black jumper`` () = ()

let [<Given>] ``I have (.*) black jumpers left in stock`` (n:int) =
    stockItem <- { stockItem with Count = n }

let [<When>] ``he returns the jumper for a refund`` () =
    stockItem <- { stockItem with Count = stockItem.Count + 1 }

let [<Then>] ``I should have (.*) black jumpers in stock`` (n:int) =
    let passed = (stockItem.Count = n)
    Debug.Assert(passed)
```

# Step definitions (C#)

```
public class StockStepDefinitions
{
   private StockItem _stockItem;

   [Given(@"a customer buys a black jumper")]
   public void GivenACustomerBuysABlackJumper()
   {
   }

   [Given(@"I have (.*) black jumpers left in stock")]
   public void GivenIHaveNBlackJumpersLeftInStock(int n)
   {
      _stockItem = new StockItem() { Count = n };
   }

   [When(@"he returns the jumper for a refund")]
   public void WhenHeReturnsTheJumperForARefund()
   {
      _stockItem.Count += 1;
   }

   [Then(@"I should have (.*) black jumpers in stock")]
   public void ThenIShouldHaveNBlackJumpersInStock(int n)
   {
      Debug.Assert(_stockItem.Count == n);
   }
}
